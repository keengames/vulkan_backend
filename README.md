# keen games vulkan backend

This repository contains a snapshot of our vulkan graphics backend. This is hopefully useful for interested programmers out there wondering how an actual vulkan backend may look like. 
It's meant as a reference and it wont compile out of the box. The code depends on a lot of proprietary code that we can’t publish. It should still be interesting for people looking for an idea how certain things can be implemented. We don’t claim this is the best way – and there probably are bugs in the code (I would be very happy if you could report them)

Kind Regards
Julien
